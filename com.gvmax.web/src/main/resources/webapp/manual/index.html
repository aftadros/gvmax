                    	<h2><a name="Workings" id="Workings"></a>How GVMax works</h2>
						<p>When you receive an SMS or a Voicemail on your Google Voice number you can ask Google to send you an email notification.
						GVMax uses these email notifications from Google to extract the sms and voicemail and then sends you notifications.</p> 
						<p>In order for GVMax to receive these emails, an email filter is created that forwards your Google Voice emails from your gmail
						account to the GVMax server. If when signing up to GVMax you provide your google voice password these filters and other settings
						are automatically created for you. If you don't then you will have to manually create these filters as described <a href="#Filters">below</a>.  
						</p>
						<p>GVMax can send you notifications even when you don't provide it your Google Voice password (with the exception of the SMS notifier).
						But providing it with your password will make the whole experience alot more seamless. I take privacy and security very seriously (remember I am
						also a user of GVMax) so you can review my <a href="../privacy/">privacy statement and security</a> precautions.						</p>
<br/>
						<hr/>                    	
                    	<h2><a name="Setup" id="Setup"></a>GVMax Setup</h2>
                    	Setting up GVMax is very simple. In most cases all you will need to do is provide GVMax with your Google Voice credentials during the signup process and it
                    	will do the rest. In a small number of cases GVMax might not be able to automatically create the emails filters, for example if your Google Voice account is forwarding your
                    	emails to non gmail based email address. 
                    	<p>If you choose not to provide GVMax your credentials you will need to follow the instructions in the following section to manually create the necessary filters.</p>
                    	<h3><a name="Filters" id="Filters"></a>Email Filters</h3>
                    	Creating email filters is easy. After signing up you will find a button on your account page 'Create GMail Filters' that you can click and have
                    	GVMax create the filters automatically. This process requires your google voice password. If you do not want to provide it then please follow the
                    	simple instructions found in the <a href="../filters">Manually installing filters</a> page.
                    	<br/>
                    	<br/>

               	        By default after signing up you will start to receive notifications (either GTalk notifications or email notifications depending on how you signed up).
               	        From your account page you will be able to change how GVMax sends you notifications and the type of notifications you get (SMS,Voicemail etc). The account
               	        page contains detailed help on the various settings.

               	        <p>GVMax can send you new SMS and Voicemail notifications to your IM application. The only requirement is that your IM program support GoogleTalk.</p>
               	        <p>When a new SMS arrives from one of your contacts (say this contact is called MyFriend and his number is 12345678) you will receive an IM chat message
               	        from a IM buddy called MyFriend (note if MyFriend was not in your GoogleContacts then the buddy name will be called 12345678)</p>
               	        <p>Replying to the chat message will cause the reply to be sent to MyFriend via an SMS to his number (12345678)</p>

               	        <p></p>There are many more features provided by GVMax when using an IM program. To get an overview of them you can
               	        type <span class="style1">gg</span> while chatting with any of your GVMax buddies. This will display a summary of the available commands which are described
               	        in more detail below.
               	        
               	        <h4><a name="IM_AddBuddy" id="IM_AddBuddy"></a>Adding a buddy to your IM roster</h4>
               	        <p>Whenever you receive an SMS or voicemail from someone they are automatically added to your IM roster (The 'roster' means your list of IM buddies).
               	        But sometimes you might want to add a new number manually, there are two ways of doing this.               	        </p>
               	        <ol>
               	          <li>Using your IM program add a new buddy with the following address {number}@mygvmax.appspotchat.com . Where number is the phone number you are adding (for US numbers
               	           do not add country code (eg if the number was (858) 123-4567 you should use 8581234567@mygvmax.appspotchat.com (no dashes or spaces))). </li>
       	                  <li>Alternatively start a chat with any existing GVMax buddy and type <br />
   	                        <span class="style1">gga {number}</span> (where number follows the same format as above)</li>

               	        In the chat window type <span class="style1">ggi</span> if your buddy can be found in your Google contacts, GVMax will display his email addresses and 
               	        phone numbers.

   	                	
       	                <h4><a name="IM_SelectingForwardPhone" id="IM_SelectingForwardPhone"></a>Selecting which phone to use for GoogleVoice calls</h4>
       	                <p>When calling numbers via GoogleVoice you need to specify which phone Google should call you on to connect you (forwarding phone). 
       	                If you have more than one phone tied to your google voice number you need to select which one should be used. 
       	                You can do this through your application's web interface or from within your IM program. </p>
       	                <p>Firstly in your IM chat window type <span class="style1">ggp</span> 
       	                This will display a list of the available forwarding phones, 
       	                take note of the index number on the left hand side for the phone you would like to use, 
       	                then type <span class="style1">ggp {index}</span>. 
       	                Now when you call a contact that phone will ring and you will get connected via GoogleVoice.</p>
   	                
       	                <h4><a name="IM_MakingCallsToBuddy" id="IM_MakingCallsToBuddy"></a>Calling a buddy via GoogleVoice</h4>
       	                <p>In the chat window simply type <span class="style1">ggc</span></p>. GVMax will place the call and your forwarding phone should ring, pick it up and you will
       	                get connected to your buddy.
       	                
       	                <h4><a name="IM_MakingAnyCall" id="IM_MakingAnyCall"></a>Calling any number using GoogleVoice</h4>
       	                <p>In any GVMax chat window type <span class="style1">ggc {number}</span></p>. As above your forwarding phone should ring and connect you to that number.
       	                
       	                <h4><a name="IM_SendingBulkSMS" id="IM_SendingBulkSMS"></a>Sending SMS to groups of people</h4>
       	                <p>With GVMax you can send SMS to groups of people. The grouping is controlled by your Google Contacts groups. </p>
       	                <p>Type <span class="style1">ggr</span> this will display your list of groups, take note of the index number for the group you would like to send the SMS to, 
       	                then type <span class="style1">ggr {index}</span> this will cause a new buddy to be added to your roster. The buddy will have the same name as the group. 
       	                When you send an IM to this buddy an SMS will be sent to each of the members in this group. GVMax will send you a reply IM stating exactly who was sent an SMS.</p>
       	                You can list the members of a groups by typing <span class="style1">ggrl {index}</span> where again the index comes from the <span class="style1">ggr</span>

						<h3><a name="TwitterFeatures" id="TwitterFeatures"></a>Twitter Features</h3>
						The current Twitter related features are still experimental. Right now you can 
						specify a Twitter account which GVMax will then send a direct message to whenever
						an SMS or Voicemail is received. Replying to these direct messages will NOT cause
						an SMS reply. Twitter support is being expanded so watch out for some news soon.
                    	<br/>
                    	<br/>
                    	<hr/>
						<h3><a name="SMSFeatures" id="SMSFeatures"></a>SMS Features</h3>
						GVMax can also send you SMS notifications! This may seem strange initially but it has its uses.
						In particular GVMax can send SMS notifications for a group of numbers (defined by a Google Contacts group).
						<br/>
						Using this feature you can make your google voice number act as a communications hub. Take me as an example
						I have a google voice number which I tied to my 'Family' group. Whenever I send an sms to this number all
						members of my family receive it. In tern their replies are sent to all other members of the group.
						<br/>
						<hr/>
						<h3><a name="AutoRespondFeature" id="AutoRespondFeature"></a>Auto Respond Feature</h3>
						If you are away with no internet access you can get GVMax to automatically respond to SMS and Voicemail (voice mail from mobile
						numbers only). Under the Notifiers dialog you will find a field that allows you to turn this feature on/off and specify the
						auto response message.
						<br/>

                    	<h2><a name="Tips" id="Tips"></a>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                    	<h3><a name="Fallback" id="Fallback"></a>GTalk fallbacks</h3>
                    	Some IM clients particularly on the iPhone sometimes will logout a user without any indications.
                    	This may cause the user to not get the notification. 
                    	<br/>
                    	To deal with this issue you should specify either a Prowl api key or an email address in your account page (you don't need to
                    	enable them). If GVMax notices that you are not logged into GTalk (and GTalk is your only enabled notifier) it will fallback to
                    	either Prowl or email. What this means is that in general you will be getting GTalk notifications only, but if for some reason you
                    	get logged out of GTalk, then a Prowl or email message will be sent.
